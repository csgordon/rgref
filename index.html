<p>Rely-Guarantee references are a marriage of ideas from rely-guarantee reasoning to ideas from reference immutability.</p>

<p>The core ideas of the approach are to associate a
rely relation and a guarantee relation with each reference.  The guarantee limits the actions
(side effects) that may be performed using that reference, and thus generalizes a family of type
systems called reference immutability, where a mutability restriction is associated with each
reference.  The rely summarizes the guarantees of all possible aliases (an invariant preserved on the creation of any new alias).</p>

<p>These relations grant us two useful things:</p>

<ol>
<li>The guarantee provides fine-grained control over what mutation a function may perform on its arguments.</li>
<li>The rely permits us to add to a reference a refinement predicate (logical
formula) that must hold of a reference's referent. If a predicate is preserved by the rely
relation (i.e. if it is true in one state, and there is another state related to the first by the
rely relation, then it is true in the second state as well), then it is safe to assume that
predicate holds in general because the actions possible through any other alias are subsumed by
the rely.</li>
</ol>

<p>For more technical details, see our <a href="">PLDI'13 paper</a>.</p>

<p>There are three implementations of rely-guarantee references:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/csgordon/rgref">csgordon/rgref</a>: A sequential rely-guarantee implementation as a shallow axiomatic DSL in Coq.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/csgordon/rgref-concurrent">csgordon/rgref-concurrent</a>: A <em>concurrent</em> rely-guarantee implementation as a shallow axiomatic DSL in Coq, with examples of proving properties of lock-free data structures.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/csgordon/rghaskell">csgordon/rghaskell</a>: A restricted version of concurrent RGRefs implemented as a library for <a href="https://github.com/ucsd-progsys/liquidhaskell">Liquid Haskell</a> (which therefore uses inference and SMT to complete proofs, rather than interactive Coq proofs)</li>
</ul>

<p>The Coq DSLs are implemented for Coq 8.4.  The Liquid Haskell embedding requires a specific version of Liquid Haskell (see that page for details).</p>
